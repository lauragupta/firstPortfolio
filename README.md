# firstPortfolio

This first portfolio site is a live site presenting a clean view of my recent projects, the deployed links, reference to the code, and information about the project. It is responsive and uses Bulma CSS Framework to style it. 

## Features
Here are some screenshots of the way the site is responsive. 

This is the top of the page for mobile...
